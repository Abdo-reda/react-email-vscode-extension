# React Email Renderer
![LOGO](./assets/logo.png)

**React Email Renderer** is an extension for the React Email Package. Its suppose to be a plug & play extension, no need for any complex setup or configuration.

Instead of having to manually setup a starter project in order to view your react mails, this extension allows you to directly view/preview them in vscode. This extensions **renders your emails behind the scenes automatically**. 
View changes in realtime, input props dynamically, view compiled code. This in theory, should result in faster workflows. 

This is **NOT an official extension from React Email**, its more of a passion/learning project made by me because I was bored `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.
